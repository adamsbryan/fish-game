# fish-game

Creating a simple multi-level game using vanilla Javascript!

Game will be played on a webpage canvas (taking up most of the screen). There will be a single player that moves around
with 1 simple objective: to collect bubbles.

There will be an animated background with different "enemies" that must be avoided. Once a certain number of bubbles
are collected, the user can move on to the next level!

Enjoy!
