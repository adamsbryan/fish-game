# fish-game

Created an interactive 2D game using only vanilla JavaScript. I learned some new coding techniques, most notably how to use canvas but also some new ways of styling and using buttons.

Partially followed a tutorial before adding a bunch of own features. Tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl29qI62XPg&ab_channel=Frankslaboratory

Own features added on include:

  Player lives
  
  Game over
  
  Settings - change player skin
  
  Invincibility frames after player damage
  
  Multiple enemies
  
  Sounds / music
  
  High score
  
  Difficulty increase
  
  Start / Play Again buttons
